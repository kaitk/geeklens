# GeekLens

A browser extension that enhances Geekbench CPU benchmark results formatting by annotating tests with instruction set architecture (ISA) information.

![GeekLens Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.png)

## Features

- üîç Automatically annotates Geekbench CPU result pages with instruction set information
- üé® Color-codes instruction sets by type (AVX, AVX-512, SSE, AES, SHA)
- üìä Shows which instruction sets are utilized by each benchmark test
- ‚ö° Works with Geekbench 6 CPU results

## Why GeekLens?

Geekbench is a powerful benchmarking tool, but it doesn't show which CPU instruction sets are being used in each test. GeekLens fills this gap by overlaying this  information directly on benchmark result pages, helping users understand which CPU features are being tested and why certain CPUs might perform better on specific tests.

## Installation

### Chrome
1. Install from the [Chrome Web Store](#) (coming soon)
2. Or install manually:
   - Download this repository
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the repository folder

### Firefox
1. Install from [Firefox Add-ons](#) (coming soon)
2. Or install manually:

   - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select any file in the repository folder

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Visit any Geekbench 6 CPU result page (e.g., https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/11907485)
3. GeekLens will automatically enhance the page with instruction set annotations

## Data Sources

The instruction set data is based on the Geekbench 6 benchmark internals documentation which can be found here: https://www.geekbench.com/doc/geekbench6-benchmark-internals.pdf
